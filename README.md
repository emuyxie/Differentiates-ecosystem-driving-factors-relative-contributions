Abstract:

The biggest sustainability challenge is improving ecosystem production services while preserving other functions at large scales. One solution is to seek a delicate equilibrium from complex nonlinear trade-offs between socioeconomic development, climate change, and environmental protection to maximize ecosystem services. This solution’s thrust is understanding these factors' relative contributions (RC) to long-term ecosystem changes, which provides crucial information for effective ecosystem management. Here, we propose a novel approach based on deep learning to assess the RC from two climate factors, four types of land uses (LUs), three environmental pollution indicators, and 29 socioeconomic variables from 2001 to 2018 across the Inner Mongolia Plateau. Compared with conventional panel regression models, we found that the deep learning models identified precipitation as the most critical feature contributing to primary productivity, a proxy for ecosystem production and health in grasslands. However, eight LUs, environmental pollution, and socioeconomic factors exhibit an additive contribution far more than precipitation alone. The deep learning models can support feature engineering to remove multicollinearity and non-linearity limitations, identify spatiotemporal abnormal patterns, analyze fine-grained features’ contribution to individual prediction, and automatically calibrate optimal model parameters, which the standard statistical methods lack.  This study illustrates an innovative and testable deep-learning-based modeling approach to discern the RC of various factors that affect ecosystem production functions and health. It has profound policy implications for improving the grassland management on the Mongolia plateau in the face of increasingly rapid human-induced environmental change. It can be adopted in other ecosystem studies and regions.
